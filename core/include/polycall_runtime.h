 *
 * `abi_major` is the host's POLYCALL_RUNTIME_ABI_VERSION. The plugin must
 * compare it against the value it was itself compiled against (its own
 * POLYCALL_RUNTIME_ABI_VERSION) and refuse to register on a mismatch. Inside
 * a compatible call, register operations with polycall_runtime_register().
 *
 * Return POLYCALL_PLUGIN_OK on success.
 * Return POLYCALL_PLUGIN_ABI_MISMATCH when abi_major is not what the plugin
 * expects -- the loader reports this distinctly from other failures.
 * Return POLYCALL_PLUGIN_ERROR for any other registration failure (for
 * example, polycall_runtime_register() itself refuses a duplicate
 * service.operation -- registering the same service.operation twice, whether
 * from two plugins or a plugin and a built-in, is always refused, never
 * "last one wins"; see docs/PLUGINS.md).
 *
 * A non-zero return rejects the WHOLE plugin: none of its operations are
 * served, and `run --load` exits with POLYCALL_EXIT_UNSUPPORTED (4).
